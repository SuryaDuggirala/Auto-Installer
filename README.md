# Auto-Installer

If this is being done on a Mac, make sure you have Xcode downloaded. This is essential to installing several separate packages onto your computer. If this isn’t a Mac, you have the wrong auto install package. I am working on the Windows, Linux, and UNIX auto install packages and they will be up in the future. 

This auto install is intended to create a working copy of OpenCV on your computer. This initiative originated in an attempt to replace MatLab in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and specifically Sylvain Costes’s cancer research lab. 

OpenCV is a fully open source multi-language, multi-platform image processing library that incorporates quite possibly the largest collection of image processing algorithms together in a single library. For more information, check out http://opencv.org/ .
